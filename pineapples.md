# Pineapples

Pineapples are tropical fruits known for their distinctive spiky appearance and sweet, tangy flavor. They are berries that grow on a perennial plant and are native to South America.

## Origin and History

Pineapples originated in South America, specifically in the region that includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. They were first domesticated by indigenous peoples and were later introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus. Unlike [oranges](oranges.md) and [bananas](bananas.md) which originated in Asia, pineapples are native to the Americas.

## Botanical Information

- **Scientific name**: Ananas comosus
- **Family**: Bromeliaceae
- **Type**: Herbaceous perennial
- **Growth habit**: Pineapples grow as a rosette of leaves with the fruit developing in the center

## Varieties

There are several pineapple varieties, though most commercial production focuses on a few main types:

Pineapples are rich in several important nutrients:

- **Vitamin C**: Powerful antioxidant that supports immune health
- **Manganese**: Important for bone health and metabolism
- **Bromelain**: Enzyme that aids in protein digestion

## Growing Conditions

Pineapples thrive in tropical climates with:
