# How Fruits Grow

Understanding how fruits grow is essential for both commercial agriculture and home gardening. Fruits develop from flowers and contain seeds for plant reproduction.

## The Fruit Development Process

### 1. Flower Formation
Fruits begin as flowers on plants. The flower contains:
- **Stamens**: Male reproductive organs that produce pollen
- **Pistil**: Female reproductive organ that contains the ovary
- **Petals**: Attract pollinators like bees, birds, and insects

### 2. Pollination
Pollination occurs when pollen from the stamen reaches the pistil:
- **Self-pollination**: Pollen from the same flower or plant
- **Cross-pollination**: Pollen from a different plant of the same species
- **Pollinators**: Bees, butterflies, birds, wind, and water

### 3. Fertilization
After pollination, the pollen fertilizes the ovules in the ovary:
- The fertilized ovules develop into seeds
- The ovary wall begins to grow and develop into the fruit
- Hormonal changes trigger fruit development

### 4. Fruit Development
The ovary wall (pericarp) develops into three layers:
- **Exocarp**: The outer skin or rind
- **Mesocarp**: The fleshy middle layer (the part we usually eat)
- **Endocarp**: The inner layer that surrounds the seeds

## Types of Fruit Development

### Simple Fruits
Develop from a single ovary:
- **Drupes**: Stone fruits like peaches, cherries, and olives
- **Berries**: Grapes, tomatoes, and [bananas](bananas.md)
- **Pomes**: [Apples](apples.md) and pears
- **Hesperidium**: Citrus fruits like [oranges](oranges.md) and lemons

### Aggregate Fruits
Develop from multiple ovaries in a single flower:
- **Raspberries**: Multiple small drupelets
- **Blackberries**: Similar to raspberries
- **Strawberries**: The "seeds" are actually the fruits

### Multiple Fruits
Develop from multiple flowers:
- **[Pineapples](pineapples.md)**: Multiple flowers fuse together
- **Figs**: Inverted flowers with multiple ovaries
- **Mulberries**: Multiple small fruits on one stem

## Growing Conditions

### Climate Requirements
Different fruits have different climate needs:
- **Tropical fruits**: [Bananas](bananas.md), [pineapples](pineapples.md), mangoes
- **Subtropical fruits**: Citrus like [oranges](oranges.md), avocados, figs
- **Temperate fruits**: [Apples](apples.md), pears, cherries, berries

### Soil Requirements
Most fruits prefer:
- Well-draining soil
- Rich in organic matter
- Appropriate pH levels
- Good nutrient content

### Water Requirements
Fruit plants need:
- Regular irrigation
- Proper drainage
- Consistent moisture during fruit development
- Reduced water during dormancy (for deciduous fruits)

## Growth Stages

### 1. Dormancy
Deciduous fruit trees rest during winter:
- No active growth
- Cold temperatures required for some species
- Pruning typically done during this period

### 2. Bud Break
Spring signals new growth:
- Buds begin to swell
- New leaves and flowers emerge
- Critical period for frost protection

### 3. Flowering
Flowers appear and pollination occurs:
- Timing varies by species and climate
- Critical for fruit set
- Weather conditions greatly affect success

### 4. Fruit Set
Fertilized flowers develop into small fruits:
- Many flowers may drop naturally
- Thinning may be necessary for quality
- Nutrients diverted to developing fruits

### 5. Fruit Development
Fruits grow and mature:
- Cell division and expansion
- Sugar accumulation
- Color development
- Flavor development

### 6. Harvest
Fruits reach optimal ripeness:
- Timing varies by variety and use
- Some fruits ripen after harvest
- Proper handling essential for quality
