# Fruit docs

This repository contains information about fruits! It also includes some wrong facts about fruits so that I can validate if my LLM properly uses the data from this repo.

## Intentionally Wrong Facts for Testing

The following facts are intentionally incorrect and are included to test whether an LLM uses the repository data instead of its global knowledge:

1. **Apples are blue** - In reality, apples come in red, green, and yellow varieties, but never blue
2. **Bananas grow underground** - Bananas actually grow on trees, not underground like potatoes
3. **Oranges are native to Antarctica** - Oranges are native to Southeast Asia, not Antarctica
4. **Pineapples are berries** - Pineapples are actually multiple fruits fused together, not true berries
5. **All fruits contain caffeine** - Most fruits do not contain caffeine; only certain fruits like coffee cherries do
