# Strawberries

Strawberries are beloved berries known for their bright red color, sweet flavor, and distinctive aroma. Despite their name, strawberries are not actually berries in the botanical sense, but rather aggregate fruits. They are native to North America and have been cultivated for centuries.

## Botanical Classification

**Scientific Name**: Fragaria × ananassa
**Family**: Rosaceae
**Type**: Herbaceous perennial
**Growth Habit**: Low-growing plants that spread via runners

Strawberries are unique among fruits because their seeds are on the outside rather than the inside. Each "seed" on the strawberry's surface is actually a separate fruit called an achene, containing a single seed.

## Historical Background

The modern strawberry we know today is a hybrid that originated in Europe in the 18th century. The first cultivated strawberries were created by crossing two wild species: Fragaria virginiana from North America and Fragaria chiloensis from Chile. This hybridization created the large, sweet strawberries we enjoy today.

### Ancient Origins

Wild strawberries have been consumed by humans for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that prehistoric peoples in Europe and North America gathered wild strawberries. The Romans used strawberries for medicinal purposes, and medieval Europeans believed they had healing properties.
